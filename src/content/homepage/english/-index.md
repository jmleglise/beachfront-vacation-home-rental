# Nous
nous:
  title: "Who we are"
   # image: "/images/hp_explore_post_card.jpg"
  content: "We are Isabelle, Justine, Marion, and Jean-Marc, and we are delighted to welcome you to our home. We welcome you with trust and, for your comfort during your vacation, we leave most of our equipment at your disposal: bikes, barbecue, books, music, and more.

  We recently discovered the region and decided to settle here after having rented many vacation homes ourselves, in Brittany, the South of France, and beyond. Every day, we appreciate this region more and more—embracing its elements, fresh air, and the joy of exploring the many nearby activities. We share some of our discoveries on our blog.

  This house has undergone several transformations. Originally a small fisherman's house, it was first renovated in 2000, then completely renovated and transformed again in 2024 when we acquired it. We have taken great care to preserve some architectural features of Norman coastal homes to honor the local tradition.

  We also invite you to discover the diversity of local architecture, where elegant villas from the birth of seaside tourism in the 1860s coexist with the quaint homes of sea workers."

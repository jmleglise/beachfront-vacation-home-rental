# Nous

  title: "Who we are"
   # image: "/images/hp_explore_post_card.jpg"
  content: "We are Isabelle, Justine, Marion, and Jean-Marc, and we are delighted to welcome you to our home. We welcome you with trust and, for your comfort during your vacation, we leave most of our equipment at your disposal: bikes, barbecue, books, music, and more.

  We recently discovered the region and decided to settle here after having rented many vacation homes ourselves, in Brittany, the South of France, and beyond. Every day, we appreciate this region more and more—embracing its elements, fresh air, and the joy of exploring the many nearby activities. We share some of our discoveries on our blog.

  This house has undergone several transformations. Originally a small fisherman's house, it was first renovated in 2000, then completely renovated and transformed again in 2024 when we acquired it. We have taken great care to preserve some architectural features of Norman coastal homes to honor the local tradition.

  We also invite you to discover the diversity of local architecture, where elegant villas from the birth of seaside tourism in the 1860s coexist with the quaint homes of sea workers."

# FAQ
faqContent:
  - title: "Can the vacation home be rented for a weekend ?"
    content: "Renting the house requires putting everything in order to make you feel at home. This takes a lot of effort! So during school holidays, we prefer weekly rentals from Sunday to Sunday. In the low season, a minimum of 3 nights is required."
  - title: "Is parking available?"
    content: "Yes, on the property, 2 vehicles can be parked one behind the other."
  - title: "Does this vacation rental have a pool ?"
    content: "No, the vacation home does not have a pool. The beach is at the end of the garden! The Aquabella aquatic complex in Ouistreham is just a 4-minute bike ride away. (70m water slide, splashpad, and a solarium to relax with your feet in the sand. Various aquatic activities are scheduled throughout the year: aquabike classes, aquafitness, baby swimming, etc. Around €6 per day per person.)"
  - title: "Is the rental suitable for babies or people with reduced mobility ?"
    content: "Unfortunately, neither. We do not have baby equipment. The stairs and windows are currently not secured. For people with reduced mobility, there are 2 bedrooms, a toilet, and a ground-floor shower room, but the kitchen and living room are upstairs."
  - title: "What are the amenities of the house ?"
    content: "The house is fully equipped, as it is our primary residence. Fully equipped kitchen, garden with gas barbecue and gas plancha, washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, Nespresso coffee maker, toaster... Feel free to ask us about any specific equipment you might need."
  - title: "How far is the vacation home from the beach ?"
    content: "Precisely 35m from the front door. However, depending on the tide coefficient, you might have to walk much further to reach the sea :-) The house is located on a frontline plot, with the gate opening directly onto Boulevard Aristide Briand along Riva Bella beach. The house is situated towards the back of the plot, providing slight protection, which is appreciated during strong winds."

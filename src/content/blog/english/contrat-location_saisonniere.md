Legal Rules for Vacation Rentals

<h2>A Written Contract is Mandatory</h2>
The property owner must provide the tenant with a contract, which the tenant must sign and return within a maximum of 15 days. This document must detail the rental price, stay duration, charges, the amount of the security deposit and booking fee, as well as a complete property description. A mandatory property description provides practical and technical details such as general condition, equipment, check-in and check-out times, and more. 

<h2>Down Payment or Deposit for Reservation</h2> 
To confirm a booking, the tenant is required to pay the owner a sum, often 25% of the total rental amount. The contract must specify whether this payment is a deposit or a down payment:
Deposit: Deducted from the total amount if the tenant confirms the rental. If the tenant cancels, the sum is retained by the owner.
Down Payment: More binding, it commits the tenant to paying the full amount even in case of cancellation. For tenants, paying a deposit is less risky.

<h2>The Security Deposit</h2> 
The contract may include a security deposit, typically between 20% and 30% of the rent. This amount is paid upon arrival after the initial inventory inspection and refunded after the departure inspection, provided no damage is found. Refunds may also occur within a timeframe specified in the contract, often 7 to 10 days. In case of damage, the deposit will be used for repairs with supporting invoices. If the amount is insufficient, the tenant must cover the remaining costs. 

<h2>Insurance for the Stay</h2> 
While not mandatory, property owners may require tenants to take out a “vacation rental” insurance policy. This is often included in comprehensive home insurance policies. If not, tenants must obtain temporary insurance to cover their stay. 

<h2>Essential Questions to Ask Before Booking</h2> 
To avoid unpleasant surprises, ask all necessary questions before signing to ensure the property meets your specific needs:
Accessibility by transport
Suitability for the age and number of participants
Conditions of use, such as noise levels, party restrictions, proximity to hazards like the sea, accessibility for people with reduced mobility, and pet policies.

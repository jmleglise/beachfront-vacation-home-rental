The scallop is a true institution in Ouistreham. We love it and regularly buy it at the fish market (10 minutes by car from Villa Tamaris). So it seems only natural that it has its own festival…

This weekend, on October 21-22, 2023, we had the pleasure of experiencing the Scallop Festival in Ouistreham Riva-Bella, an annual event celebrating Normandy’s famous scallop. The atmosphere was festive and friendly on General de Gaulle Square. Numerous artisan and merchant stalls offered local products, and a stage hosted concerts with music reminiscent of Breton fest-noz celebrations. We particularly enjoyed the bands "Kat Mataf" and "Les Mat’lots," who created a wonderfully festive vibe.

Several activities were also organized, but since we hadn’t explored the various reservation options, we couldn’t participate in them all. There were sea outings organized by the sea rescue service, cooking workshops, and a visit to the Ouistreham lighthouse, exceptionally open for the occasion. The lighthouse, with its 171 steps, offers a breathtaking view of the port and the Normandy coast.

Gastronomy was at the heart of the festival, with cooking demonstrations and tastings to learn how to prepare dishes featuring scallops. Local restaurants also participated in the "Scallops at Every Table" initiative, offering special menus showcasing scallops.

The Scallop Festival in Ouistreham Riva-Bella is an unmissable experience for seafood lovers and maritime culture enthusiasts. We had an excellent time as a family, enjoying culinary discoveries, activities for all ages, and a warm atmosphere. We highly recommend this festival, and it’s a great excuse to plan a weekend and rent our vacation home, Villa Tamaris.

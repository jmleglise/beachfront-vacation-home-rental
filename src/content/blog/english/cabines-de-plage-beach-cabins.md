The famous and highly photogenic beach cabins of Normandy evoke the charm of yesteryear and the spirit of family vacations, an ambiance that also inspires vacation home rentals in the region. These small white structures, lined up along the beaches of Cabourg, Ouistreham, and Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, look as if they’ve come straight out of a postcard. I knew it was a tradition in the region, but I hadn’t realized just how integral these cabins are to Normandy’s seaside history.

In doing a bit of research, I learned that the first beach cabins were installed as early as 1820, meeting the need to swim discreetly, away from prying eyes, at a time when sea bathing was becoming popular, especially among wealthy Parisian families in search of rest and sea air. Renting a vacation home in Ouistreham allows us to carry on this tradition!

Today, owning a cabin is a rare and highly coveted privilege. Cabins are often rented out by local municipalities, but demand is so high that one sometimes needs to join a waiting list. Some families even have the fortune of passing them down through generations, almost like a family heirloom. I can imagine the charm of a cabin that has stood the test of time, witnessing memories and vacations over the years.

Each cabin has its own unique decoration, offering glimpses of character as you stroll by. It’s fun to see how the names or numbers displayed on the doors seem to reflect personal stories. These cabins are not just practical shelters but also little havens where families gather, share stories, exchange laughter, and simply enjoy life by the sea.

All of this reflects a certain art of vacationing, which inspired us to offer a vacation home rental that continues these traditions.

The Côte de Nacre is filled with charming and authentic unique features.

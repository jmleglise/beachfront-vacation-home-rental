If you have the pleasure of enjoying our seaside vacation rental and appreciate open horizons, continue the experience with a visit to Luc-sur-Mer to stroll along the Fishermenâ€™s Pier. This charming spot is truly worth the trip. The entirely wooden pier offers breathtaking views of the sea horizon and is perfect for an evening walk. With a bit of luck, you might even catch a glimpse of fishermen in action, bringing in their daily catch. The setting is so peaceful that you could spend hours there. Originally installed in Ouistreham, this pier was relocated to Luc in 1971.

In the end, our region offers numerous attractions worth seeing, and a week-long vacation rental will be just enough time to fully enjoy them.

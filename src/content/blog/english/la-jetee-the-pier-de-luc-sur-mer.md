If you have the pleasure of staying in our seaside vacation rental and enjoy open horizons, extend the experience by visiting Luc-sur-Mer to stroll along the fishermen’s pier. This charming spot is truly worth a visit. The wooden pier offers a breathtaking view of the marine horizon and is perfect for an evening walk. With a bit of luck, you might even spot fishermen at work, hauling in their catches of the day. The setting is so peaceful that you could easily spend hours there. This pier, impressive in both width and length, was relocated from the Ouistreham outer harbor in 1971 and extends the Brèche Marais into the sea.

Luc-sur-Mer, a classified seaside resort, is also renowned for its Whale Park, where you can admire the skeleton of a 19-meter whale that washed ashore on the beach in 1885.

The park, located just steps from the sea, is a verdant haven filled with trees and flowers, home to goats, birds, and majestic peacocks, making it a delightful spot for a family stroll.

Additionally, Luc-sur-Mer features a 1.5-kilometer-long seawall, perfect for seaside walks, and a casino dating back to the late 19th century, adding a touch of historical charm to your stay.

Finally, our region offers numerous attractions worth exploring, and a week-long vacation rental will barely be enough to take it all in.

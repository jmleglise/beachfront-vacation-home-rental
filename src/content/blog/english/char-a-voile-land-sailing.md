Our first land sailing experience was very enjoyable and an immediate success. It’s an activity that’s very easy and accessible to everyone (starting from age 8, as kids do just as well as adults). Although we probably weren’t going very fast at first, we quickly began to feel the thrill.

If you rent our seaside vacation home, this activity is a must for all ages.

Book in advance, as sessions vary based on tides (in Luc) and weather conditions. Here is the link for Ouistreham (10 minutes by bike): https://www.calvados-tourisme.com/offre/centre-nautique-ocean-ecole-de-char-a-voile/. The meeting point is directly on the beach in the designated area.
And here for Luc-sur-Mer (10 minutes by car from the house): https://lyc.asso.fr/char-a-voile/ — meet at the building to get equipped with the provided rain gear/pants.

Before starting, it’s essential to equip yourself properly. In addition to the helmet (and rain gear in Luc) provided by the center, it’s recommended to wear closed-toe shoes that can get wet, gloves to protect hands from rope friction, and sunglasses to shield your eyes from sand spray in Luc.

The session starts quickly, allowing you to enjoy it fully from the first time. A quick briefing covers safety instructions and how the land yacht operates. Equipped with three wheels and a sail, the yacht is piloted by using your feet for steering and your hands to control the sail. Pressing the left pedal turns you right, and vice versa. Pulling the sheet tightens the sail and speeds up the yacht, while releasing it slows it down. If you have sailing experience, you already know everything you need to know.

And you’re off. You quickly find pleasure in feeling the wind and playing with speed. The wind fills the sail, propelling the yacht across the damp sand. The sensations are a blend of karting and sailing. Each acceleration provides a feeling of great freedom, as the yacht glides effortlessly over the sand.

Since then, I’ve tried it again. Each time, you improve your turns, adjust your trajectory according to the wind and gusts, and it’s just as enjoyable each time.

These two clubs introduced me to an activity that’s accessible, easy for everyone, and full of excitement. Whether you’re a beginner or looking for new adventures, land sailing offers a unique opportunity to connect with nature while having fun. I highly recommend trying it out when you stay at our seaside vacation home.
